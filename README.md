Fibi is a detailed content and copy writer, tech event moderator and an open-source design advocate on a mission to educate designers in Africa about open source and it's potential.  

She is currently part of the lesson fixing team at Oppia Org; an open source platform making education easily accessible to those who may not have access to it.

When she's not putting on her full tech regalia, you can catch her baking the world into a better place. Fibi loves dancing and putting smiles on the faces of other people.
